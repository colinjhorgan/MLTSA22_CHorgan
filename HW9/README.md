For this submission I collaborated with Jonathan Hicks and Justin Lambobard. I contributed a significant amount of the code concerning extracting output from the
auto-encoder, training the random forests, and producing plots to visualize our results. Justin and Jonathan contributed much of the code which defines and trains
our auto-encoder. They both contributed significantly in their ideas as to how my final submission is presented.
