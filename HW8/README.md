This work was completed with cooperation with Justin Labombard and Jonathan Hicks. No code was taken directly from either of them. Our collaboration was to
establish a pipeline through which we could achieve time series of identical length and spacing using interpolation. Justin and Jonathan suggested the use of interp1d
from scipy, and I refined the code used to apply interpolation to all of the time series contained within our data. I provided them with the code to do this efficiently
in one line for the linear case.
