All code written in this submission is my own. I did not collaborate with other peers on this assignment with the exception of asking Jonathan Hicks to confirm
that Dynamic Programming is the method we are to use with runtime O(kn^2) (the paper lists it as O(Ckn^2) where C is the complexity of our cost function). He also 
directed me towards normal cost function when I was achieving sub-ideal results using L1 and L2 on LANL data.
